 /* Check whether the letter guessed by the user is in the secret word
  that was randomly chosen by the computer. For example, if the user guesses 
  the letter "a" and the secret word is "apple", then your code should check if "a" is in "apple".

Step 1. Create an if statement that checks if the guess is in the word.

Step 2. In the body of the if statement, print a message saying "Good guess! {guess} is in the word.". Obviously, format the string to show the actual guess instead of {guess}.

Step 3. Create an else block that prints a message saying "Sorry, {guess} is not in the word. Try again." This block of code will run if the guess is not in the word.
